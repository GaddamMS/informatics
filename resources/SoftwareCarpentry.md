---

OU Informatics team members are trained in teaching methods and the course
material of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).  Software
Carpentry is supported by the Mozilla Foundation and works to train scientists
in best practices of scientific computing by providing and maintaining
instructional materal on:

* The Unix Shell (how to automate repetitive task)
* Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way)
* Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and
* SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).

These are run as two-day "Bootcamp" workshops and require all participants to
be present for the entire course.  Bootcamp coordination and event signup pages
can be provided by the Software Carpentry administrative organization.  There
is a requested donation of $1,500 to support the ongoing development of new
course material and operations of the Software Carpentry organization.


Software Carpentry is an international organization and it is not required to
go through Research Informatics to run a Bootcamp.  We would however appreciate
being notified of any Bootcamps you have planned, or plan to attend being run
by other organizations so that we can keept track of the activity.
